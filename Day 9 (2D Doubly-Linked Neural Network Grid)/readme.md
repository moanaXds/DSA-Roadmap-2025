This project implements a 2D doubly-linked grid of nodes (“neurons”), where each node points up, down, left, and right, forming a fully navigable mesh.
You can:

Create a grid of custom size

Traverse it like a matrix

Modify individual cells

Remove a node by value

Reverse a full column

Print the grid in matrix form
